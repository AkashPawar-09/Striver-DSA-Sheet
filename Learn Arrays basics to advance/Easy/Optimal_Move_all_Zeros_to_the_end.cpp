/*

Input: 1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
Output: 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0
Explanation: All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

Input : 1,2,0,1,0,4,0
Output: 1,2,1,4,0,0,0
Explanation : All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

Input: nums = [0, 1, 4, 0, 5, 2]
Output: [1, 4, 5, 2, 0, 0]
Explanation: Both the zeroes are moved to the end and the order of the other elements stay the same

Input: nums = [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, -2]
Output: [1, 3, -2, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: All 3 zeroes are moved to the end and the order of the other elements stay the same
